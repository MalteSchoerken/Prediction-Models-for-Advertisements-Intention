# Prediction-Models-for-Advertisements-Intention
Comparison of 8 Machine Learning Models and 3 Feature Selections for predicting the intention of online advertisement.

816 advertisements were used to classify three specific marketing strategies, namely \enquote{price leadership}, \enquote{quality leadership} and \enquote{time leadership}. Each of the advertisements was assigned manually to exactly one of these categories. To select the best prediction model, a total of eight machine learning models, including for example \enquote{Gaussian Process}, \enquote{Random Forest} and \enquote{Neural Network} were used along with various feature extraction methods such as \enquote{Named Entity Recognition}, \enquote{Sentiment Analysis}, and \enquote{Keyword Extraction}. Keyword Extraction was either done manually or supervised using the \enquote{YAKE!}-method. \enquote{Grid Search} was used in all cases to optimize the models. In total three runs were done for each of the machine learning models with different feature selections and the results were comparatively analyzed.
